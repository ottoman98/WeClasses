            <strong>Emily:</strong> Good morning, Alex! I'm doing well, thank
            you. How about you?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alex:</strong> I'm great, thanks. By the way, do you know
            what today's date is?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Emily:</strong> Yes, it's the 17th of September. My birthday
            is coming up on the 25th!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alex:</strong> That's exciting! I'll make sure to remember
            that. Would you like to do something special for your birthday?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Emily:</strong> Definitely! I'm thinking of having a small
            get-together at my house. Would you like to join us?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alex:</strong> Of course, I'd love to! What time should I be
            there?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Emily:</strong> Let's start at 3 o'clock in the afternoon.
            We'll have some games and cake.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alex:</strong> Sounds like fun! How many people are you
            inviting?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Emily:</strong> I'm inviting around ten friends. It's going
            to be a small and cozy celebration.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alex:</strong> That's a nice number. Oh, and how old will
            you be turning?
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Emily:</strong> I'll be turning 23. Time flies!
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Alex:</strong> It sure does. I'll bring a birthday gift for
            you. See you on the 25th at 3 PM!
          </p>
          <p>
